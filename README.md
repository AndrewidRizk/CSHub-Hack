# Inspiration
We were inspired by the apparent lack of connection on campus and our desire to make a difference. We decided we would try to help the campus population connect with social events being centralized.

# What it does
OnCampusNow allows for a website which contains events fetched from multiple event calendar sources across York University.

# How we built it
We built it using a Flask and JavaScript frontend and a mySQL/Python backend.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges developing the frontend as all of our group members lack experience developing frontend. Additionally, the pressure and time constraint was another challenge.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how far we developed our application considering the time constraint. We are also proud of being able to develop a backend database in this time.

# What we learned
We learned collaboration skills and how to use mySQL. The collaboration skills particularly are invaluable and this experience helped a lot.

# What's next for OnCampusNow
Next, we are looking to further develop our frontend and further organize our backend. Additionally, in the long term OnCampusNow is something we would like to be able to make available for multiple universities across Canada.
